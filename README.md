FIle "basics.py" is a piece of code that you can play with. It is adapted from this repo: https://github.com/Oktosha/DeepSDF-explained

Note that "basics.py" is not the re-implementation of DeepSDF (https://github.com/facebookresearch/DeepSDF) but more similar to the paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09808) in the sense that the network is trained to overfit a single shape (but 2D in our case).
